### Toplines 

All mentions of spin rate are adjusted for velocity.

* The average spin rates for fastballs from pitchers have been climbing year over year since 2017 but in the three weeks after June 3 of 2021, the average to levels lower than they've ever been before spin data began being tracked

*Nearly 70% of pitchers who threw more than 10 fastballs after June 3 saw a decrease in their average adjusted spin rates compared to the earlier 2021 season

* The data is on spin is new– less than five years of data has been collected. Experts are still trying to determine the effects of really high spin rates, but the data shows that spin rates have of many pitchers increased year over year since 2017

* For many, the spin rates peaked in 2020 and 2021 but has since declined after June 3 (nearly half the players)
  * Like Trevor Bauer, Gerrit Cole, Brad Boxberger, Lucas Sims, Tyler Mahle, and Adam Ottavino (and Junior Guerra and Burch Smith)

* Some teams in particular have also been increasing their spin rates every season since 2017
  * More than half of teams have been growing spin rates and saw a drop after June 3
  * A handful of them, such as the Cincinnati Reds and Brewers have seen a dramatic drop after June 3

* Some teams saw increase in the spin rates of the pitchers who joined them compared to their prior team the year before.
  * The average spin rate increase is .35 when pitchers get traded to a new team but there are 8 teams that are more than 3 -5 times that
  * The Astros, Brewers, Cardinals, and Padres each had notable increases in recent years

* It's still too early to say what the effects of lower spin rates have had on games
  * The average number of hard hits from fast ball pitches have increased on average per game

```

Nearly (`r round(decreased)`%) of pitchers who threw more than 10 fastballs after June 3 saw a decrease in their average adjusted spin rates compared to the earlier 2021 season.

The drop is interesting when compared to how pitchers have increased their spin rates through the years: `r ba4_aggregate$changed_total` out of `r ba4_aggregate$total` -- nearly half.
