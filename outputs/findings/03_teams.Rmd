This team look up is part of The Washington Post Story [How baseballâ€™s war on sticky stuff is already changing the game](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/07/02/sticky-stuff-baseball-data/)

More of the methodology of the analysis can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/baseball_spin).

The table lists the average adjusted spin rate (rotations per minute divided by miles per hour) for each time period.

Only players who've thrown at least 20 pitches since June 3 were included in the table.
